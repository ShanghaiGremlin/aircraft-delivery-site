    <p><b>Q: How much do you pay?</b> A: Pilots bid on their pay. You can choose from a daily rate, an hourly rate, or a flat fee. I'll advance your information and pay bid to the client. In the event the client counters the bid, I'll come back to you and see if you're still interested. Your pay comes from the client, so essentially they are paying you, not I. </p>

    <p><b>Q: How do you make money?</b> A: I charge the client a Support and Supervision fee which is independent of pilot pay.</p>
    <p><b>Q: How am I insured for a flight?</b> A: Clients carry aircraft insurance policies which provide for damage and liability coverage. Pilots are encouraged, but not required, to carry supplemental liability insurance.</p>
    <p><b>Q: Am I responsible for any expenses during a ferry mission?</b> A: No. All expenses are reimbursed, except food and drink which are covered by <i>per diem.</i> Personal entertainment (like movie tickets, video rentals, etc.) won't be reimbursed.

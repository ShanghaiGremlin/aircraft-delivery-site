<h1 class="page-title-brick">PILOT HIRING</h1>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">I’m always looking to add pilots to my roster. This page has details. All it takes to get started is a message or call to me.</h2>
<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 24px;"><a href="/about">Aircraft Delivery Solutions</a> (A.D.S.) hires <b>contractor pilots</b> for individual ferry missions. All pilots are contractors and I <b>don't carry any pilot employees.</b> Pilots possessing a Commercial or higher certificate (any Administration, Agency, etc) can <b>join the <a href="/pilot-directory">A.D.S. pilot roster</b></a> in one of two ways:</p>
<p style="font-size: 24px;"><b>1. Marketed</b></p>
<ul style="padding-left: 40px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">
            <li>Your face, first name and last initial appear on the <a href="/pilot-directory">“Ferry Pilot Directory"</a> page of Aircraft.Delivery. </li>
            <li>Brief bullet points highlight your pilot qualifications.</li>  
            <li>You're available to bid on ferry flights and want to receive notices from A.D.S. about new flight opportunities.</li>
            <li>Rules:
            <ol style="margin-top: 8px; padding-left: 20px;">
                <li>There's no cost to you to join or remain 'marketed'. </li>
                <li>Cancel your marketing at any time with no questions asked. </li>
                <li>You have control about the way your listing looks, and I will show you a draft listing for your approval prior to it going live.</li>
            </ol></li></ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;"><b>2. Non-marketed.</b> <span style="font-size: 20px;">You <u>don't</u> appear on the website. You <u>are</u> available to bid on ferry flights and want to receive notices from A.D.S. about new flight opportunities.</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 24px;"><b>Reasons you may want to be 'marketed'</b></p>
<ul style="padding-left: 40px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">
            <li>You are lending your credibility to A.D.S., and with that increased credibility, A.D.S. will likely get more inquiries. More inquiries likely means more opportunities for you.</li>
            <li>A prospective client can read your <a href="/pilot-directory">listing</a>, and if they see something they connect with, can ask for you by name. For example, I place a US flag on the <a href="/pilot-directory">photos of US military veterans</a> so website visitors that care about that can identify US veterans.</li>  
            <li>It's completely free and you can cancel any time.</li></ul>

  <div class="accordion-content">
    <p>For pilots based in the United States: (Pilots based outside the United States will be considered on a case-by-case basis)</p>
<p>1. For fixed-wing pilots, hold a FAA Commercial or Airline Transport Pilot certificate with a Single-Engine Land rating and an Instrument Airplane rating.</p>
<p>2. For rotary-wing pilots, hold a FAA Commercial or Airline Transport Pilot certificate with Helicopter rating</p>
<p>3. Have logged 500 hours of Pilot-in-Command time, 100 hours of cross-country (defined here as a landing more than 50 nautical miles from the takeoff airport), and 35 hours of night time.</p>
<p>4. Mastery of the English language, including aviation English.</p>
<p>5. [Not necessary for rostering-to be completed prior to first assignment] Successful completion of interview and reference check by A.D.S.. Pilots must supply two references. It's my job to examine qualifications, talk about needs and reasons for wanting to ferry aircraft, and ultimately decide if their personality, and technical skill, make them a good fit.</p>

  <button class="accordion-header">Ferry Pilot F.A.Q.<span class="chevron">⌄</span></button>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <p><b>Q: How much do you pay?</b> A: Pilots bid on their pay. You can choose from a daily rate, an hourly rate, or a flat fee. I'll advance your information and pay bid to the client. In the event the client counters the bid, I'll come back to you and see if you're still interested. Your pay comes from the client, so essentially they are paying you, not I. </p>
    <p><b>Q: Do you take a cut of my pay?</b> A: No. I don't take a cut or percentage of anything.</p>
    <p><b>Q: How do you make money?</b> A: A charge the client a Support and Supervision fee which is independent of pilot pay.</p>
    <p><b>Q: How am I insured for a flight?</b> A: Clients carry aircraft insurance policies which provide for damage and liability coverage. Pilots are encouraged, but not required, to carry supplemental liability insurance.</p>
    <p><b>Q: Am I responsible for any expenses during a ferry mission?</b> A: No. All expenses are reimbursed. Two exceptions: 1. Personal entertainment (like movie tickets, video rentals, etc.) 2. Alcohol purchases are allowed but won't be reimbursed. In the event of uncertainty, check with me before you buy.</p>

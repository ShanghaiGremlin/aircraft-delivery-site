    <p><b><i>Aircraft Delivery Solutions Testimonial</i></b></p>
<p><b>Customer Name:</b> Paul Carswell</p>
<p><b>Aircraft Type:</b> Piper PA-28-180</p>
<p><b>From/To:</b> Marshfield, Massachusetts (KGHG) to Hickory, North Carolina USA (KHKY)</p>
<p><b>Date:</b> May 2025</p>
<p><b>Pilot:</b> Justin A.</p></div>
<p>"I recently purchased my first aircraft and needed to have it ferried from Massachusetts to North Carolina.   I found Aircraft Delivery Solutions through a Google search.  I contacted them on Saturday and they contacted me that afternoon.  I closed on my purchase a few days later on Thursday and by Tuesday my plane was delivered to me in NC.  The communication was outstanding.  Aaron was always prompt in replies and offered relevant & useful information along the way.  Justin was my pilot and both he and Aaron were easy to work with and shared numerous updates with me on the journey to NC.  I cannot express how smooth and easy the process was.  I will always use Aircraft Delivery Solutions when I purchase another plane in the future.  The process was too easy and no stress whatsoever."</p>

<p><b>Customer Name:</b> Robert Schlotzhauer</p>
<p><b>Aircraft Type:</b> Lancair IV-P</p>
<p><b>From/To:</b> Mesa, Arizona (KFFZ) to Lee's Summit, Missouri (KLXT)</p>
<p><b>Date:</b> September 2013</p>
<p><b>Pilot:</b> Aaron K.</p></div>
<p>"After talking with Aaron at some length regarding his experience and diversification of aircraft he had flown I decided that he had the capability of bringing the aircraft back safely.  Fortunately for me Aaron had the presence of mind to check with the FAA to verify registration of the aircraft and it was disclosed that the registration has been canceled just two weeks prior to my contacting him.  After going through the FAA reregistration of the aircraft Aaron was finally able to get the aircraft back just as he said he would in one day.  Aaron gave me complete records of all expenditures and performance of the aircraft and did everything he said he would do.  I was very impressed with the thoroughness of Aaron's business expertise and the way he treated our aircraft.  I would recommend this service to anyone who had need to move an aircraft from point A to point B."</p>

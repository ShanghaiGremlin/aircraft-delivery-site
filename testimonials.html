<p style="margin: 0;"><b>Pilot:</b> Justin A.</p>
<p>"I recently purchased my first aircraft and needed to have it ferried from Massachusetts to North Carolina. I found Aircraft Delivery Solutions through a Google search. I contacted them on Saturday and they contacted me that afternoon. I closed on my purchase a few days later on Thursday and by Tuesday my plane was delivered to me in NC. The communication was outstanding. Aaron was always prompt in replies and offered relevant & useful information along the way. Justin was my pilot and both he and Aaron were easy to work with and shared numerous updates with me on the journey to NC. I cannot express how smooth and easy the process was. I will always use Aircraft Delivery Solutions when I purchase another plane in the future. The process was too easy and no stress whatsoever."</p>

<p>"After talking with Aaron at some length regarding his experience and diversification of aircraft he had flown I decided that he had the capability of bringing the aircraft back safely.  Fortunately for me Aaron had the presence of mind to check with the FAA to verify registration of the aircraft and it was disclosed that the registration has been canceled just two weeks prior to my contacting him.  After going through the FAA reregistration of the aircraft Aaron was finally able to get the aircraft back just as he said he would in one day.  Aaron gave me complete records of all expenditures and performance of the aircraft and did everything he said he would do.  I was very impressed with the thoroughness of Aaron's business expertise and the way he treated our aircraft.  I would recommend this service to anyone who had need to move an aircraft from point A to point B."</p>

<p>"I contacted FlyIt4U with the request to relocate my Cessna 172 from Frederick, Maryland to Skagit Valley in Washington state. Aaron was quick to reply and provided a very clear plan and set of expectations for accomplishing the goal. His input was timely, communication during the planning and preparation phase was complete and we met in Frederick, Maryland on the planned departure date. Aaron kept me advised throughout the flight and delivered the aircraft in 3 days to the designated location. He encountered a thunderstorm with hail while on the ground in Omaha and made quick plans for a temporary hangar, while keeping me in the loop by instant messaging. I was very impressed with his professionalism throughout the process."</p>

After making initial contact with Aaron, I was left with the impression that I was dealing with a professional. From start to finish, he made the process far less onerous than I had anticipated that it was going to be. Great communication, service and value. FlyIt4U will be my first choice to deliver aircraft in the future."</p>

<p>"I recently purchased a PA28-181 based in Sonoma and needed to get it to Houston. I shopped around a little to find a ferry pilot and was quickly frustrated with the process &ndash; I felt like I had to work hard to even get a response from some! Luckily I found Aaron with FlyIt4U, who was quick to respond, called me personally, and provided a reasonable quote right away. An economical and feel-good bonus for me was that he was local to the Bay Area and familiar with routes through the mountains. I have no complaints about FlyIt4U&rsquo;s service &ndash; the flight was conducted safely, scheduling was flexible, receipts were provided for all expenses (all of which were reasonable) and statistics were delivered on the performance of the aircraft during the flight. I do not hesitate to recommend their service and would use it again."</p>

<p style="margin: 0;"><b>Pilot:</b> Aaron K.</p>
<p>"I was in the market for a Piper Cherokee 180. Unfortunately, the one I wanted to buy was located several hundred miles away. I arranged the purchase, paperwork and before sale inspections to be handled through the phone, mail and internet. When it came to delivery to my location, I found out that it would be quite expensive and time consuming to fly myself and another pilot to Santa Barbara to bring the plane home. I called Flyit4U and they quoted a price for delivery that was way too reasonable to pass up. It was actually cheaper than doing it myself and everything was handled quickly and efficiently. Aaron took care of all the logistics and in a very short period of time, he had parked my airplane at my home airport and was handing me the keys. It doesn't get any easier than that! I've spread the word locally that this is the cheapest, safest and easiest way to have an airplane delivered that I've found. I highly recommend this service."</p>

<p>"My initial impression was how helpful they were in explaining what was involved, what was needed, and the approximate cost. They answered all of my questions, no matter how trivial, as this was the first time I needed to hire ferry services. The process itself was extremely easy. Each morning and at the conclusion of the last leg for the day, I got a call to give me a status update. The cost that we had mentioned was within 6 percent of budget, which was amazing given all the variables and that was because of questionable weather and we both agreed it would not be wise to fly. Being in sales for almost 20 years, I always look at how a person or company treats their Clients and prospects in every aspect. I was truly satisfied with the service of FlyIt4U. From the beginning to the end, I could not have asked for better service. As a side note, because of his knowledge, and my experience with FlyIt4U, I hired them to help me get current in my new aircraft."</p>

<p>&ldquo;I recently used FlyIt4U to ferry my Piper Arrow. They were a pleasure to deal with, prompt, professional and willing to accommodate my plans. Even with a border crossing in the middle of the flight they made every effort to keep costs down and get the airplane here on schedule. We were in constant contact throughout the flight and I always knew where they were. They even helped with Customs and provided a detailed report on how the airplane performed relative to book numbers for cruise and fuel burn. A top-notch service, I would recommend FlyIt4U to anyone."</p>

I felt the decision-making was solid, and they kept me updated often. Working with them was straightforward and reasonable, and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a ferry pilot."</p>

<p>"I must admit, I was worried about entrusting my brand-new 2005 Cessna 182 to just anyone, but immediately after the first conversation with FlyIt4U, I knew I was in good hands. After my initial contact they took over from there and put me completely at ease. The service was extremely professional, prompt and detailed. I enjoyed how well the website was put together, and how informative it was. They took no chances with my new bird when they made the right decision to wait out unfortunate weather. They provided a quote and a detailed explanation of their services and then delivered beyond my expectations."</p>

<p>"I bought my first plane and hired a pilot to fly it to Oregon for me, but the weather was out of his comfort range. Well, the thought of leaving my first plane sitting on a ramp 600 miles away for another week was almost unbearable. I started looking for another pilot. I found FlyIt4U.com and sent a email. Within 30 minutes they replied. We were making arrangements within 15 minutes by phone. The next day they landed at RDM around 1500. You couldn't ask for better service. Plus, the pilot is a CFI and I was a student at the time. He took me for my first flight in my first plane. It meant a lot to me."</p>

<p>"As a first-time plane buyer, I did a lot of things wrong. The plane I found was on the opposite side of the country, I negotiated everything over the phone, and the "pre-buy inspection" was done by the owners' mechanic. The only thing I did right was find FlyIt4U. They delivered my plane, came in under budget, and informed me of all of the little nuances that would have taken me weeks to find. Luckily, everything else worked out OK and their delivery of my plane was the icing on the cake."</p>

<p>"In September 2006 I purchased a G-Model Bonanza in Portland, Oregon and needed someone to fly the plane to my home in Alaska. After doing some research I called FlyIt4U. Within a couple of hours I received a cost estimate along with a planned route. Twenty-four hours later they arrived in Portland. The pilot was very knowledgeable and professional. They delivered my plane earlier than expected and below the cost estimate. In addition, they provided a detailed account of the airplane's performance. Without reservation, I would recommend FlyIt4U to anyone needing a ferry service for their airplane."</p>
